## Overview

The `main` method in `EuroPythonBot/bot.py` is the entry point for the bot.
I't a good starting point to start browsing the codebase.
It requires a `.secrets` file in the root of the repository with `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` and `PRETIX_TOKEN` environment variables.

### Registration

At EuroPython, we use [pretix](https://pretix.eu/about/en/) as our ticketing system.

The bot utilizes the Pretix API to fetch ticket information and creates an in-memory key-value store to retrieve the ticket type for a given Discord user. The mapping between ticket types and Discord roles is defined in a JSON file, such as ticket_to_roles_prod.json, and is used by the bot to assign roles to users.

There are safeguard methods in place to prevent users from registering multiple times and to make a direct Pretix API call in case the user information is not available in the in-memory store.


### Program notifications

Is a service to push the programme notification to Discord. Pretalx API is used to fetch the programme information, and `config.toml` holds information about livestream URLs.

### Organizers extension
A set of commands that are available only for organizers that are allowing to get statistics about the Discord server.

## Setup
### Install Python, Pipenv, Pyenv (Ubuntu)
```shell
# dependencies of readline, sqlite3, ctypes
sudo apt install libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev lzma libbz2-dev liblzma-dev

# python, pip
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip

# pyenv
curl https://pyenv.run | bash
pyenv install 3.11.4

echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo '[[ -d $PYENV_ROOT/bin ]] && export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'eval "$(pyenv init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc
. ~/.bashrc

# pipenv
python3 -m pip install pipenv
```

### Clone repo, install dependencies, run tests
```shell
# clone repo, install dependencies
git clone https://github.com/EuroPython/discord europython-discord/
cd europython-discord

# install dependencies
python3 -m pipenv install --dev

# run tests
python3 -m pipenv run pytest .
```

### Configuration
Create `config.local.toml` file in EuroPythonBot directory, it would be used instead of `config.toml` if exists.

Add `.secrets` file to the root of the repository with the following content:
```shell
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=<EuroPythonTestBotToken_from_1Password>
PRETIX_TOKEN=<PretixStagingToken_from_1Password>
````
After you have added the `.secrets` file, you can run the bot with the following command:
```shell
pipenv run python EuroPythonBot/bot.py
```
or with docker:
```shell
docker build --tag discord_bot .
docker run --interactive --tty --env DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=$DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN --env PRETIX_TOKEN=$PRETIX_TOKEN discord_bot
```
