## Overview

The `main` method in `EuroPythonBot/bot.py` is the entry point for the bot.
I't a good starting point to start browsing the codebase.
It requires a `.secrets` file in the root of the repository with `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` and `PRETIX_TOKEN` environment variables.

### Registration

At EuroPython we use [pretix](https://pretix.eu/about/en/) as our ticketing system.

The bot uses the pretix API to fetch the ticket information and create in-memory key-value store to retrieve the ticket type for a given discord user.
The mapping between ticket types and discord roles is defined in JSON file, e.g. see `ticket_to_roles_prod.json` and is used by the bot to assign roles to users.

There are safeguard methods preventing users to register multiple times and to make a direct pretix API call in case the user information is not available in the in-memory store.


### Program notifications

Is a service to push the programme notification to Discord. Pretalx API is used to fetch the programme information, and `config.toml` holds information about livestream URLs.

### Organizers extension
A set of commands that are available only for organizers that are allowing to get statistics about the Discord server.

## Setup
Create `config.local.toml` file in EuroPythonBot directory, it would be used instead of `config.toml` if exists.

Add `.secrets` file to the root of the repository with the following content:
```shell
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=<EuroPythonTestBotToken_from_1Password>
PRETIX_TOKEN=<PretixStagingToken_from_1Password>
````
After you have added the `.secrets` file, you can run the bot with the following command:
```shell
pipenv run python EuroPythonBot/bot.py
```
or with docker:
```shell
docker build --tag discord_bot .
docker run --interactive --tty --env DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=$DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN --env PRETIX_TOKEN=$PRETIX_TOKEN discord_bot
```
