## Overview

The `main` method in `PyConESBot/bot.py` is the entry point for the bot.
I't a good starting point to start browsing the codebase.
It requires a `.secrets` file in the root of the repository with `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` and `PRETIX_TOKEN` environment variables.

### Registration

At PyConES, we use [pretix](https://pretix.eu/about/en/) as our ticketing system.

The bot utilizes the Pretix API to fetch ticket information and creates an in-memory key-value store to retrieve the ticket type for a given Discord user. The mapping between ticket types and Discord roles is defined in a JSON file, such as ticket_to_roles_prod.json, and is used by the bot to assign roles to users.

There are safeguard methods in place to prevent users from registering multiple times and to make a direct Pretix API call in case the user information is not available in the in-memory store.


### Program notifications

Is a service to push the programme notification to Discord. Pretalx API is used to fetch the programme information, and `config.toml` holds information about livestream URLs.

### Organizers extension
A set of commands that are available only for organizers that are allowing to get statistics about the Discord server.

## Setup
### Install Rye (Linux systems)
```shell
# dependencies of readline, sqlite3, ctypes
sudo apt install libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev lzma libbz2-dev liblzma-dev

# rye
curl -sSf https://rye.astral.sh/get | bash

# add the required info to the .profile file if your system supports it. Otherwise, consider
# using .bashrc, .zshrc, etc. More info at: https://rye.astral.sh/guide/installation/#add-shims-to-path
echo 'source "$HOME/.rye/env"' >> ~/.profile
```

### Using Rye
This is a summary of useful `rye` commands.
Please refer to the [Rye documentation](https://rye.astral.sh/guide/basics/) for details.

```shell
# generate venv from pyproject.toml
rye sync

# install package and update all other packages
rye add package
rye add --dev package  # install as dev dependency

# remove package
rye remove package
```

### Clone repo, install dependencies, run tests
```shell
# clone repo, install dependencies
git clone https://github.com/Javinator9889/pycones-discord-bot.git
cd pycones-discord-bot

# install dependencies
rye sync

# run linting and tests
rye run black --check .
rye run isort --check .
rye run flake8 .
rye run pytest .
```

### Configuration
Create `config.local.toml` file in PyConESBot directory, it would be used instead of `config.toml` if exists.

Add `.secrets` file to the root of the repository with the following content:
```shell
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=<PyConESBotToken>
PRETIX_TOKEN=<PretixStagingToken>
````
After you have added the `.secrets` file, you can run the bot with the following command:
```shell
rye run python PyConESBot/bot.py
```
or with docker:
```shell
docker build --tag pycones-discord_bot .
docker run --interactive --tty --env DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=$DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN --env PRETIX_TOKEN=$PRETIX_TOKEN pycones-discord_bot
```
