This is crucial: For instance, if you suddenly introduce all the tools you can find, chances are that the only thing you’ll learn from the plethora of alerts you’ll get is how to ignore these tools. Since some of us also have to deal with corporate policies and a limited sphere of influence within an organization, I will end with some pointers on how to advocate good security practices from the bottom up.\r\n\r\nAnd, if this all feels a bit overwhelming, remember the big friendly letters in the title: [**Don’t Panic!**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy)","duration":30,"slot_count":1,"do_not_record":false,"is_featured":false,"content_locale":"en","slot":{"room_id":2190,"room":{"en":"South Hall 2A"},"start":"2023-07-20T15:30:00+02:00","end":"2023-07-20T16:00:00+02:00"},"image":null,"resources":[]},{"code":"NLZZBQ","speakers":[{"code":"8EGVC9","name":"Cheuk Ting Ho","biography":"","avatar":"https://pretalx.com/media/avatars/IMG_1037_vjqZpqv.jpg"}],"title":"Polars vs Pandas - what's the difference?","submission_type":{"en":"Talk"},"submission_type_id":2749,"track":{"en":"PyData: Software Packages & Jupyter"},"track_id":3565,"state":"confirmed","abstract":"Have you heard about Polars?

The only way to participate in the growing debates around what our code should and should not do, he reasoned, would be to enter the world of the people writing it, by learning to code himself. Nice idea! In a near thirty year writing career, Smith had flown to the edge of space, slept under Spearfish torpedoes aboard a nuclear hunter-killer submarine, roamed the vast Victorian sewer system under London, spent six months on the road with Bianca Jagger, toured with artists including Radiohead and The Prodigy, and been perhaps the only person ever to shake Fidel Castro's hand by accident. None of which prepared him for the challenge of learning to code. After a miserable false start with JavaScript, a kindly C++ programmer pointed him in the direction of Python and he fell in love not just with the language, but with the remarkable community behind it. In this unusual keynote, Andrew, with help from his great friend and Python stalwart Nicholas Tollervey, will describe what he found—explaining the joys, frustrations and surprises, while touching on his experiences in Silicon Valley and the intriguing historical discoveries he made during his research. Smith's meditation on code's relationship to the wider world, Devil in the Stack: Searching for the Soul of the New Machine, will be published next March.

It will transform how you write tests, especially for APIs. \r\n\r\nI made some contributions to it, which forever changed how I thought about `NotImplemented`. I thought it was a placeholder for unfinished work and unexpected use cases. I thought the language quirks it created in equality comparison were annoying. \r\n\r\nBut in **DirtyEquals**, it’s a magic way to transform Python’s built in equality operator... And that changed how I think about language quirks, full stop.","description":"*Intro (5m)*\r\n\r\nI adore Pydantic. It's a fantastic library that creates classes which check types at Python runtime. In short, it turns type hints into static types.\r\n\r\nI had a crush on the code that did this. I thought it was so cool to trick Python into behaving this way. I wanted to learn how this library worked. But when I went to contribute to it, I saw it wasn't looking for contributions.\r\n\r\nSo, I decided to look at his other projects in the hope I could learn something there.\r\n\r\n*What is Dirty Equals (10m)*\r\n\r\nThis is how I discovered **DirtyEquals**. This library lets you write tests in a whole new way. With **DirtyEquals**., you get to (mis)use Python’s equality operator in way that speeds up testing. \r\n\r\n**DirtyEquals** lets you write assert statements that compare objects to custom types, This makes your tests more declarative and more readable. I’ll go over several examples in this section.\r\n\r\n*How Does It Work (10m)*\r\n\r\nYou might be thinking, isn’t it strange that the Python equality operator can work in this way? Shouldn’t it return False, since the **DirtyEquals**. types are different to the types they’re compared to?\r\n\r\nThis is where things get interesting. It turns out that if you write `x == y` in Python, three things happen:\r\n\r\n1. First, Python looks at `x.__eq__` to see if x and y are the same.\r\n2. If `y` is a new type, it returns `NotImplemented` because the `y`'s type isn’t part of Python’s built ins. So there isn’t an implementation for how Python checks the type for equality.\r\n3. But - here’s the kooky bit - Python then checks `y.__eq__` ! So if we can hook into the `y.__eq__` part, we can write our own rules for the equality operator.\r\n\r\nThere are so many things you can do mucking around with `.__eq__` and `.__ne__`, which is what I’ll cover in this section.\r\n\r\n*Conclusion (5m)*\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to coding, I think we should pursue our crushes. If there’s code that you find attractive, then see if you can contribute! As a result, I learnt things I would never have learnt any other way.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the main thing I learnt was a completely different approach to coding. To me, mucking around with the `.__eq__` seemed like a terrible idea that would cause untold errors.\r\n\r\nBut when I saw someone else do it so well, it seemed like a magic trick. I now no longer think of language quirks as problems. I consider them opportunities to perform magic tricks.","duration":30,"slot_count":1,"do_not_record":false,"is_featured":false,"content_locale":"en","slot":{"room_id":2193,"room":{"en":"Terrace 2B"},"start":"2023-07-20T14:00:00+02:00","end":"2023-07-20T14:30:00+02:00"},"image":null,"resources":[]},{"code":"SURAC3","speakers":[],"title":"Sprint Orientation","submission_type":{"en":"Talk"},"submission_type_id":2749,"track":null,"track_id":null,"state":"confirmed","abstract":"","description":"","duration":20,"slot_count":1,"do_not_record":false,"is_featured":false,"content_locale":"en","slot":{"room_id":2189,"room":{"en":"Forum Hall"},"start":"2023-07-21T17:30:00+02:00","end":"2023-07-21T17:50:00+02:00"},"image":null,"resources":[]},{"code":"Z7HAUH","speakers":[{"code":"MKHTB9","name":"Roy M Mezan","biography":"","avatar":"https://pretalx.com/media/avatars/me_xiOWqIM.png"}],"title":"Food For Rabbits: Celery From Zero to Hero","submission_type":{"en":"Tutorial"},"submission_type_id":2750,"track":{"en":"TBD - Multiple Tracks"},"track_id":3683,"state":"confirmed","abstract":"In a world, full of Micro-Services, distributing tasks is a constant challenge, and there's only one tool that can rule them all.\r\n\r\nIn this workshop, we'll introduce Celery - a tool for distributing tasks in an easy, fast, and flexible manner, and take you from zero to hero!\r\n- We're going to understand why we need a distributed task system, and why to choose Celery.\r\n- We'll write our first Celery task.\r\n- Understand how to configure and run Celery.\r\n- Familiarize ourselves with Celery's fundamental concepts.\r\n- Dive into celery customizable options.\r\n- Finally, we'll see a real-life example of how we used Celery in our production system and how we customized it to fit our needs, and discuss how you can do the same.","description":"**Outline:**\r\n- Setup [5 min]\r\n- What is Celery?

In this talk, you will discover the dark little secrets of how f-strings were being processed before Python 3.12 and the many things that didn't work and you didn't know about. You will learn how we changed thousands of lines of manually written C code without anybody noticing, how we changed the oldest part of CPython so quotes behave like parentheses, and how we taught the PEG parser to understand f-strings.

This does not always work well for beginners. E.g. if you have just grasped how a while-loop  works, it may cause too much cognitive load to also understand the break and continue options, let alone the else clause.\r\nThe learning psychologist Jerome Bruner introduced the term \"spiral learning\". The idea is that you don't teach all aspects of a new concept, but just enough to use it. At a later stage a teacher can revisit the subject and explain more details, when a student needs this to take the next step.\r\nSpiral Python is a road map of subjects that can be found in any introductory book or online resource about Python, but absolutely original in the sense that it takes into account how people learn in a natural way. You do not need to know the whole language before you can use it. Spiral Python also contains exercises (to practice) and challenges (to motivate).","description":"The idea of Spiral Python comes from the original Meccano construction kits. In Kit #1 you found building materials, some simple tools and a booklet with ideas what to build. It was possible, however, to build much cooler contraptions than those in the booklet. Meccano enabled children to be creative. Soon a kid needed Kit #2 to realise his or her ideas.\r\n\r\nIn a workshop, I can first summarise what cognitive psychology understands about learning (e.g. from \"How We Learn\", Dehaene 2020). Subsequently I can share our experience at Rotterdam University on what beginner programmers find difficult or misunderstand when they learn programming. In general the problem is that there is too much cognitive load, too much new ideas at once (\"The Programmer's Brain\", Hermans 2021). Finally I will sketch the Spiral Python approach, in which new concepts build on prior experience of students (e.g. the Python List is related to shopping lists and to-do lists) and gradually explained. At each stage of Spiral Python, students don't make just standard exercises but are challenged to be creative and follow their own passion in building software-driven products. We use libraries (turtle, opencv) and hardware (microbit, raspberry pi with sense hat) to make the software products more interesting.\r\nStudents that take the Spiral Python approach get used to extending and adapting the mental models they have made of the Python programming language, computers, networking and computing. This makes them more flexible and independent thinkers, who hopefully enjoy lifelong learning.","duration":30,"slot_count":1,"do_not_record":false,"is_featured":false,"content_locale":"en","slot":{"room_id":2192,"room":{"en":"Terrace 2A"},"start":"2023-07-19T14:35:00+02:00","end":"2023-07-19T15:05:00+02:00"},"image":null,"resources":[]},{"code":"T3JFHR","speakers":[{"code":"A7BNZH","name":"Michael Seifert","biography":"","avatar":"https://pretalx.com/media/avatars/michael_seifert_-_300x300_KY7yE8t.png"}],"title":"Bulletproof Python – Writing fewer tests with a typed code base","submission_type":{"en":"Talk"},"submission_type_id":2749,"track":{"en":"Software Engineering & Architecture"},"track_id":3570,"state":"confirmed","abstract":"A fully typed code base requires less test code to achieve the same level of confidence in its correctness.

For that to happen, the application must separate the domain layer— where elements that represent the real world reside—from the infrastructure layer—where these elements are translated into precise software processes.\r\n\r\nWithin the Fintech team at Kiwi.com, we are rearchitecting a critical service to accept more payment providers. As part of this refactor, we are adopting the Unit of Work pattern to disentangle domain entities from the database processes that represent them. This way, domain experts can share their knowledge with developers more easily, and developers can find opportunities for optimization without the involvement of domain experts in the process.\r\n\r\nAttendees will gain a solid understanding of how to implement the UoW pattern in their Python applications, how it fits into the broader context of DDD, and how to prepare their code for future growth.","description":"As developers modelling a domain into a software product, how can we make the most of the insights that we receive from domain experts? Crucially, a system that reads similar to how domain experts talk and think about their area of expertise enables the team to look at the codebase as a whole, and not as a mix of modules.\r\n\r\nBut in order to do that, the system must be designed in such a way that what’s relevant to the domain takes a centre stage, and implementation details stay in the background. In order to do that, we can layer the codebase so that the domain—where elements that represent the concepts and interactions that domain experts talk about— is clearly delineated from the infrastructure—where these elements find a way to be implemented in purely software engineering terms.\r\n\r\nAt Kiwi.com, we are redesigning one of our most critical services in order to expand the number of payment providers that we are integrating with, enabling us to serve a bigger and more diverse pool of customers. As part of this redesign, we are making use of the Unit of Work pattern, with which the interaction between domain entities gets abstracted from the specifics of the database in which those interactions are recorded. Much has been said about the use of abstracting elementary domain objects into a clean data model, but it is the very interaction between those objects where, in practice, the delineation between the domain and the infrastructure layer collapses.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will cover the limitations of ORMs as a way to abstract the database details from the rest of the application, and will introduce the Unit of Work pattern to address those limitations. By means of real-world examples, the attendees will learn the advantages and trade-offs that the UoW pattern was designed to overcome, and will come away with practical use cases in which this pattern makes applications cleaner and more future-proof.\r\nThe outline of the talk is the following:\r\n\r\n1.

The core is an [open source AWS emulator](https://github.com/localstack/localstack) that is primarily written in Python. It is among the top Python projects on GitHub, and has seen a massive uptake in contributions over the past two years. Many Python software developers and architects will relate to the struggles of maintaining a large and complex Python codebase, while keeping developer teams productive. In this talk, we'll explore how we at LocalStack tackle these as we re-create AWS for local development. We'll explain our approaches to automating around AWS specifications, building a highly modular and pluggable system to make it easy for teams to integrate their components, the software patterns we use to keep devs productive, as well as our approach to automated contract testing using pytest.","description":"This talk aims to provide a broad overview of LocalStack and its implementation, and at the same time provide listeners with relatable insights from our experience in architecting, developing, and maintaining a large, complex Python code base.\r\n\r\nThe outline is roughly as follows:\r\n\r\n- Intro: What's LocalStack, who am I, what problems are we solving?\r\n- Software patterns we use, and how they are implemented in Python. These include:\r\n  - A web framework based on WSGI/Werkzeug that implements the chain-of-responsibility pattern: I'll explain how this pattern is similar to WSGI middleware, and demonstrate how it allows us to plug in different types of functionality into the HTTP request processing, when this pattern is beneficial (compared to traditional web frameworks: much more flexible), and what the drawbacks are (hard to debug!)\r\n  - Other patterns found in the code base: Visitor, Adapter, Proxy, Singleton\r\n  - Monkey patching: I will briefly explain how monkey patching works, how it helps us move fast, but also how it can hurt (with real examples of when things blew up in our face), but why the trade-off leans towards using monkey patching.\r\n  - Dynamic code loading: We built an open source framework called Plux that builds a higher-level plugin mechanism around Python entrypoints. will explain both the benefits (super flexible, allows clean code organization) and the drawbacks (pretty hard at times to figure out what's going on) of dynamic code loading.\r\n- Strategies we use to maintain parity with AWS: People are usually skeptical that an idea like LocalStack can even work. \r\n  - We automate a lot around the AWS specs, for example we get weekly PRs when service APIs change. I'll demonstrate how we do server-side code generation from the AWS specs, and how that helps us.\r\n  - Snapshot testing: We have built our own contract testing framework around pytest. We use that to write contract tests against AWS, that we then run against LocalStack to ensure parity. I'll go into a bit of details of the challenges with this approach, but also how we couldn't work without it.\r\n- Wrap up and conclusion: I will tie together all the presented solutions and summarize how they help us solve the challenges. After this, the audience should have a deeper appreciation for how Python helps build something like LocalStack. I'll conclude by pointing out some of the overarching themes in this talk (like the tradeoffs between introducing certain patterns on maintainability).","duration":30,"slot_count":1,"do_not_record":false,"is_featured":false,"content_locale":"en","slot":{"room_id":2192,"room":{"en":"Terrace 2A"},"start":"2023-07-21T14:35:00+02:00","end":"2023-07-21T15:05:00+02:00"},"image":null,"resources":[]},{"code":"HL8XCC","speakers":[{"code":"QMAPYZ","name":"Antonio Cuni","biography":"","avatar":"https://pretalx.com/media/avatars/cdc3cafa377f0e0e93fc69636021ef65_5Ador3O.jpg"}],"title":"The CPU in your browser: WebAssembly demystified","submission_type":{"en":"Talk"},"submission_type_id":2749,"track":{"en":"Web"},"track_id":3573,"state":"confirmed","abstract":"In the recent years we saw an explosion of usage of Python in the browser:\r\nPyodide, CPython on WASM, PyScript, etc. All of this is possible thanks to the\r\npowerful functionalities of the underlying platform, WebAssembly, which is essentially a virtual CPU\r\ninside the browser.","description":"In the recent years we saw an explosion of usage of Python in the browser:\r\nPyodide, CPython on WASM, PyScript, etc. All of this is possible thanks to the\r\npowerful functionalities of the underlying platform, WebAssembly.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we will examine what is exactly WebAssembly, what are the strong\r\nand weak points, what are the limitations and what the future will bring us.\r\nWe will also see why and how WebAssembly is useful and used outside the\r\nbrowser.\r\n\r\nThis talk is targeted to an intermediate/advanced audience: no prior knowledge of\r\nWebAssembly is required, but it is required to have a basic understanding of what is a compiler, an interpreter and the concept of bytecode.\r\n\r\nThe introduction will cover the basics to make sure that the talk is\r\nunderstandable also by people who are completely new to the WebAssembly world,\r\nbut after that we will dive into the low-level technical details, with a\r\nspecial focus on those who are relevant to the Python world, such WASI vs\r\nemscripten, dynamic linking, JIT compilation, interoperability with other\r\nlanguages, etc.","duration":30,"slot_count":1,"do_not_record":false,"is_featured":false,"content_locale":"en","slot":{"room_id":2189,"room":{"en":"Forum Hall"},"start":"2023-07-20T11:55:00+02:00","end":"2023-07-20T12:25:00+02:00"},"image":null,"resources":[]},{"code":"MQRJXF","speakers":[{"code":"BXVSCG","name":"Roman Yurchak","biography":"","avatar":"https://pretalx.com/media/avatars/90e4251aee531aa36f6e09d7b935378f_X6t0Gow.jpg"},{"code":"BQVLYL","name":"Nicholas Tollervey","biography":"","avatar":"https://pretalx.com/media/avatars/avatar_large_FOn6ad4.jpg"}],"title":"WASM Summit","submission_type":{"en":"Conference Workshop"},"submission_type_id":3075,"track":null,"track_id":null,"state":"confirmed","abstract":"This summit aims to bring together maintainers and users of the Python with WebAssembly, to discuss the state of this ecosystem, existing challenges and ongoing work.\r\n\r\nFind out more, including how to sign up, here: [https://ep2023.europython.eu/wasm](https://ep2023.europython.eu/wasm)","description":"Agenda:\r\n   \r\n* 9:00: Meet and greet (many of us won’t know each other) + unconference-y post-it based organisation.\r\n* 9:30: Presentations (30mins each)\r\n* 11:00: Coffee\r\n* 11:20: Presentations\r\n* 13:00: Lunch at the PCC (included)\r\n* 14:00: Unconference-y activities (discussions, hacks, ad hoc tutorials etc…)\r\n* 16:00: Round-up / plenary session for feedback and organising next steps.\r\n* 18:30: Dinner","duration":90,"slot_count":4,"do_not_record":false,"is_featured":false,"content_locale":"en","slot":{"room_id":2185,"room":{"en":"Club C"},"start":"2023-07-18T09:30:00+02:00","end":"2023-07-18T11:00:00+02:00"},"image":null,"resources":[]},{"code":"GRDPPX","speakers":[{"code":"8EGVC9","name":"Cheuk Ting Ho","biography":"","avatar":"https://pretalx.com/media/avatars/IMG_1037_vjqZpqv.jpg"}],"title":"Beginner Conference Orientation","submission_type":{"en":"Talk"},"submission_type_id":2749,"track":null,"track_id":null,"state":"confirmed","abstract":"Are you new to EuroPython or any Python conference?

To streamline infrastructure management, our team set out to design a REST API and constituent CLI (Command Line Interface) that would comprise a single interface for both programmatic and human interaction with our infrastructure. Traditionally, building a CLI that is tightly coupled to an API requires maintaining a separate codebase, which is tedious and error-prone. Instead, we designed a CLI that dynamically generates commands based on the OpenAPI JSON documentation. However, since APIs are designed for computer interaction, we designed our API to include the information needed to implement a human-friendly CLI.

It has gained widespread use in various applications in recent years. Preprocessing, such as feature selection, is an important step in any machine learning or data mining task. It helps to improve the performance of an algorithm and reduce computational time by eliminating highly correlated, irrelevant, and noisy features. A new algorithm called Black Hole, inspired by the phenomenon of black holes, has recently been developed to tackle multi-label classification problems. In this talk, we present a modified version of the Black Hole algorithm that combines it with two genetic algorithm operators: crossover and mutation. The combination of Black Hole and genetic algorithms has the potential to solve multi-label classification problems across a range of domains.","description":"Multilabel classification is a machine learning task where each instance in a dataset is assigned to multiple labels. This is in contrast to traditional classification, where each instance is assigned to a single label. Multilabel classification has gained popularity in recent years due to its expanding use in a variety of applications across domains.\r\n\r\nOne of the key challenges in multilabel classification is the high dimensionality of the data, which can make it difficult for machine learning algorithms to learn effectively. This is where feature selection comes in. Feature selection is the process of identifying and selecting a subset of relevant and non-redundant features from a larger set of features. It is a critical preprocessing step that can improve the performance and efficiency of machine learning algorithms.\r\n\r\nOne of the recent developments in feature selection is the Black Hole algorithm, which is inspired by the phenomenon of black holes in space. The Black Hole algorithm is a metaheuristic that iteratively removes the least relevant features from a dataset, based on a relevance measure such as mutual information. In this talk, we present a modified standalone Black Hole algorithm that incorporates genetic algorithm operators, such as crossover and mutation, to improve its performance in solving multilabel classification problems. The hybridization of Black Hole and Genetic Algorithms has shown to be effective in solving multilabel classification problems in different domains.","duration":60,"slot_count":1,"do_not_record":false,"is_featured":false,"content_locale":"en","slot":{"room_id":2192,"room":{"en":"Terrace 2A"},"start":"2023-07-19T13:00:00+02:00","end":"2023-07-19T14:00:00+02:00"},"image":null,"resources":[]},{"code":"C7AZ33","speakers":[{"code":"BLNV7P","name":"Rodrigo Girão Serrão","biography":"","avatar":"https://pretalx.com/media/avatars/rgs_square_pMKs1bG.jpg"}],"title":"Build a terminal TODO app with Textual","submission_type":{"en":"Tutorial"},"submission_type_id":2750,"track":{"en":"Python Libraries"},"track_id":3567,"state":"confirmed","abstract":"Learn how to build powerful terminal-based user interfaces (TUIs) with ease using Textual - an open-source Python framework.\r\n\r\nThroughout this tutorial, you'll learn how to use Textual's built-in widgets, reactive features, and message-passing system to create a dynamic and user-friendly TODO app that's perfect for managing your daily tasks.\r\n\r\nFrom creating and displaying tasks to editing and deleting them, you'll cover all the essential features needed to make a functional TODO app.\r\n\r\nYou'll also learn how to use Textual CSS to style your TUI for a polished and elegant look, together with some tips and tricks to make it even easier to develop your TUIs in Textual.\r\n\r\nThis tutorial provides everything you need to get started with building TUIs in Python.

You should know Python basics and the statistical concepts of variance and correlation to understand the presentation.\r\n\r\nSpatial interpolation is the new kid on the block, and in the future, with IoT devices everywhere, it will gain much more weight (along with its relative - time-series modeling). Heavily based on statistics, it falls into a single concept:\r\n\r\n*Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more connected than distant things*. (**W. Tobler**).\r\n\r\nThe presentation will focus on one concept and two techniques:\r\n- the concept of spatial correlation (the example from the leisure & tourism market),\r\n- the point kriging technique used to interpolate values at unseen locations (weather readings enhancement),\r\n- the Poisson Kriging Area-to-Point technique for preparation of the input from regional statistics that fit into satellite-based observations (cancer rates in U.S. counties).\r\n\r\nTechniques for spatial data interpolation are used by:\r\n- mining industry,\r\n- agriculture & forestry,\r\n- defense & security,\r\n- retail,\r\n- public health,\r\n- administration, urban planning, water management,\r\n- weather forecasting,\r\n- and everywhere where we sample events distributed over an area or analyze regional statistics.\r\n\r\nWhy should we bother from the business perspective? We have various ML models, and house-price prediction is a topic of many tutorials. There are a few reasons: with spatial interpolation, we get knowledge about spatial dependencies between our samples, we get uncertainty measures, and we may perform analysis on a relatively small sample (> 50 samples) that won't work with the ML pipeline. We may even link geostatistical models within complex machine-learning pipelines.

However, these updates often require changing the database schema with migrations. In this talk, we will discuss a solution that allows the software to remain life and able to handle incoming traffic while performing migrations.\r\nTo ensure zero downtime during this process, the old code must be compatible with the new database schema. Although this may seem easy, it often isn't. In this talk, we will cover problematic operations such as:\r\n- renaming tables or columns,\r\n- deleting tables or columns,\r\n- adding new columns,\r\n- updating all records in a table with a large amount of data.\r\n\r\nWe will discuss potential problems that may arise due to certain changes and provide corresponding solutions.
