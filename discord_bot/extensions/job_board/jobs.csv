After proving its value in the OSS community, we’re now building our commercial offering, dltHub, to make data engineering accessible to all Python developers.

Our team is based in Berlin, now growing into other locations, especially across the US. Founded by experienced data and ML engineers, we're backed by Foundation Capital, Dig Ventures, and technical founders from Hugging Face, Instana, Matillion, Miro, MotherDuck, Datadog, Mode, and Rasa.

We're building a new service, ground-up, that brings together the `dlt` library, an LLM-first development workspace, and data lake storage and runtime for data pipelines and notebooks. This takes our stack beyond Python into new languages, infrastructure, and systems and we’re looking to grow the team with people who bring required skills and background. Our focus is on deeply understanding user needs and developing the best technologies to meet them. To make that happen, we’re looking for smart, driven people that, with time, will take ownership of key parts of the product.","- Design and implement our commercial product. This involves both writing Python code and listening to our customers, who are running sophisticated data platforms we augment.
- You’ll be on top of recent trends in how data platforms are built and will be able to serve as a technical expert or architect. You’ll work closely with our Solution Engineering team and help them solve real-world problems our customers face.
- Contribute to the dlt open source core, including code, tests, and documentation
- Maintain the open source project with the team (e.g., review PRs, resolve issues, talk with community contributors, write docs, etc.)","Here’s the stack we use (or plan to use) so you can quickly see if it’s a good fit for you. Strong Python knowledge is essential. You don’t need to know everything listed, but if you’re confident in any of the areas below, we’d love to hear from you:
- Python/OSS/backend: pyarrow, duckdb (data processing), ibis (data querying), data frame libraries like polars, fastapi/starlette. Rust for optimizations.
- Frontend/UI: next.js/react, Marimo/Streamlit/Jupyter (Python)
- Storage tech: DuckLake, Iceberg, Parquet, bucket storage
